**Arduino** is not alone in the universe; it can use different digital communication protocols
to talk with quite a few other systems. It's one of the great features of the platform; it has 
all of the standard protocols built in, allowing it to communicate with thousands of different
devices.

**Digital communication** has numerous advantages. It is less susceptible to noise than analog 
communication, and it usually only requires two lines to communicate to hundreds of devices.
This allows communication with the computer, with other microcontrollers such as the Arduino, 
with the Internet, and even pages to store data.

## There are two common types of the communications mention in this Git repository:
- The serial port, professionally called **Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) communication.**
- And **Inter-Integrated Circuit or I2C (pronounced I squared C).**
